<p><strong>AWS Document Text Extraction Engine</strong></p>

<p>Deployed my own SAM Code Pipeline in AWS and used CloudFormation to build and deploy templates to create a
system that accepts documents, uses AWS Textract to extract the text from the record, parse the results, and throw
the text into an AWS OpenSearch (former Elasticsearch) domain for easy searching and understanding of data set.</p>

<p><strong>Portfolio Website</strong></p>

<p>Using ReactJS I bult my own portfolio website to show my skills, experience, and my personal projects. Using AWS
Route 53 I purchased the domain and hosted the website on my own Linux server that I run from my own home.
Project was a chance for me to learn the networking, port forwarding, and DNS requirements of hosting web-based
applications.</p>

<p>Hour management app developed for a local farmer to track the hours of his employees to simplify payroll and hour
